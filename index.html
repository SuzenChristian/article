				MILAN, Italy — If there is one thing Italy would not seem to need, especially from Americans, it is another place to buy a cup of coffee.
			</p>

			<p>
				But hundreds of people in Milan thought otherwise on Friday, lining up for at least an hour to take part in the latest place-to-be event in Italy’s fashion and design capital: the country’s first Starbucks cafe.
			</p>

			<p>
				No ordinary Starbucks, this is a Reserve Roastery — the company’s third, after locations in Seattle and Shanghai — complete with an in-house coffee roastery, a 30-foot-long Tuscan marble bar, various coffee stations (customers are given a physical map to the shop) and over 115 different beverages. It lies in the heart of the city, a short walk from the Milan Cathedral and the Royal Palace in one direction, and the Sforza Castle in the other.
